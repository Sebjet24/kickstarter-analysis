# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: 
 
 - In a short length of time, Louise's play Fever came close to reaching its fundraising target. She now wants to know how various campaigns fared in terms of their debut dates and financial targets. I have been tasked to analize the data for her. The purpose of this analysis is to figure out the outcomes of campaigns depending on their launch dates dates and financial ambitions.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 - Using [Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](https://github.com/Sebjet24/kickstarter-analysis/files/7471647/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx), I created a PivotTable to visualize the Theater outcomes for the columns of "successful", "failed," and "canceled" based on launch date. I then created from the PivotTable a line graph to easily see the shifts in outcome based on month: ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91230277/140241616-309c1694-78f6-4268-8672-b91b0e7bad28.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results


- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
