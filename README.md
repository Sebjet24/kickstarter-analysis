# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose: 
 
 - In a short length of time, Louise's play "Fever" came close to reaching its fundraising target. She now wants to know how various campaigns fared in terms of their debut dates and financial targets. I have been tasked to analyze the data for her. The purpose of this analysis is to figure out the outcomes of campaigns depending on their launch dates and financial ambitions.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 - Using [Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx](https://github.com/Sebjet24/kickstarter-analysis/files/7471647/Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx), I created a PivotTable to visualize the Theater outcomes for the columns of "successful", "failed," and "canceled" based on launch date. I then created from the PivotTable a line graph to easily see the shifts in outcome based on month: ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91230277/140241616-309c1694-78f6-4268-8672-b91b0e7bad28.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

 - To better understand the outcomes based on goals, I created a new sheet that consisted of a column separating goal dollar amount:

I then created columns and functions for Number Successful,	Number Failed,	Number Canceled,	Total Projects,	Percentage Successful,	Percentage Failed, and	Percentage Canceled:

Finally, I took the percentage columns and created another line graph that gave me a good look as to what were the outcomes based on goals:

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

 - The main difficulty I ecountered was figuring out where I made mistakes in my code. Specifically, it was difficult for me to ascertain that I forgot to add the equal symbol in my functions for distributing 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
